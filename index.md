Hello, this is Xi Zhang. I am a fourth year Ph.D. student under the supervision of [Prof. Klaus Mueller](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mueller/) at [Stony Brook University](http://www.stonybrook.edu/). My research interest is in exploring state-of-art machine learning models for data mining and information retrieval.
